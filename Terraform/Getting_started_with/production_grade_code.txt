PRODUCTION GRADE TERRAFORM Code

Why it takes so long to build production grade:


How to make production grade kubernetes:
    1) Small Modules:
        Keep modules to a specific function
        Design in a way that can be used across multiple facets
    2) Composable Modules:
        Generic modules:
            modules should be a husk  for use for other modules allowing for fine-grained
            configuration
        Use-case-specific modules:
            modules that combine other modules to perform a function
        









Beyond Modules:
    When needing to perform opertions on machine or local computer:
        1) provisioner:
            - provide a way to do remote and local exec for useful commands
            Example:
                provisioner "remote-exec" {
                    inline = [""]
                }

                connection {
                    "" = ""
                }
                * provisioner: defines either remote-exec or local-exec
                * connection: required for remote-exec for SSH connections
                * self.<var>: used with provisioner and connection to reference own attributes
            * provisioners only run ONCE 
            * can have multiple provisioners with each being executed one by one
        2) provisioner null_resource:
            resource "null_resource" "foo" {
                triggers = {
                    "" = ""
                }
                provisioner "type" {

                }
            }
            provie a way to execute a provisioner without the need for creating an actual resource
            * triggers: takes in key values and when the value changes,  will trigger the resource will be re-created

        3) data "external" : how to interct with external scripts 
            data "external" "foo" {
                program = []

                query = {
                    "" = ""
                }

            }
            * program: what is being executed
            * query: optional data that can be passed to the program as json from stdin
            * accessing data: external.foo.result
