    Dependency Injection:
        1) Setup an example for the module
        2) fir external dependencies create a dependencies.tf file
        3) define variables to provide to dependencies
        4) set variables to null as default
        5) dependencies can have their creation optional through the count argument
        example: 
        data "" "" {
            count = var."" == null ? 1 : 0

        }
        Will only create if the var is set
