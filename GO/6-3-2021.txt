There is a difference between lists and slices in golang
    -lists are pre-sized arrays list [10]int
    -lists are variable sized arrayys []int

Golang * denotes a reference to a pointer & creates a pointer to a variable
    1) create the variable
    i := 10
    2) create a point to i
    p := &i
    3) change the value of i through the pointer
    *p = 12
