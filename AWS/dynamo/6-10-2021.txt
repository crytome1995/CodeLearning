In order to submit a Query to Dynamo 2 things are required:
    KeyConditionExpression
    Equality expression matching the partition key

When performing a Query can have the RCU returned by specifying ReturnConsumedCapacity:
    NONE: nothing returned (default)
    TOTAL: all RCU
    INDEXES: across all indexes
