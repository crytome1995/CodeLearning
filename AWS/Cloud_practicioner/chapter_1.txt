THE CLOUD:

5 pillars of well architected framework
1) Operational excellence:
    - Addapt from failure
    - Make small code changes
    - Automate infrastructure 
2) Security:
    - Adopt security across the design process
3) Reliability:
    - Recovery from failure
    - monitor the application
    - Adapt to demands on the application
4) Performance efficiency:
    - Never get latched down to a solution
    - always look to optomize
    - continue to adapt to change in an architecture

5) Cost optomization:
    - construct a pricing model
    - evaluate expenses


AWS:

Virtualization:
    - Aws holds numerous servers to allow the virtualization of servers for customers 
    to use
        - This allows for:
            - Speed: Servers can come up in minutes as they sit ontop of a host
            - Efficiency: A single server can host numerous VM's

Cloud Platform Models:
    1) Infrastructure as a service:
        Examples include: EC2, EBS, ELB
            The customer has more control on how to secure and implement the underlying asset
    2) Platform as a service:
        Examples include: Elastic beanstalk, Elastic container service
            The customer only has to worry about the application code that sits on the infrastructure
    3) Software as a service:
        Examples include: AWS SES
            The platform has complete control of the entire environment and a user simply uses
    4) Serverless: LAMBDA
