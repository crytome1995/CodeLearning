EC2 Best Practices

Security:
    lock down security groups
    - can be done through systems manager
    Patch/update software on instances
Storage:
    Isolate EBS volumes for OS and data
        - make sure data volume is persisted after deletion
Backup and Recovery:
    Backup EBS snapshots by using EBS snapshots
    Create AMI for instances to provide consistency and repeatability that allows for immutable infrastructure

SSM(System Manager Session Manager)
    an instance profile requiers role AmazonSSMRoleForInstanceQuickSetup
    - Allows for setting up an ssh client without needing to open up port 22 on the security group 
    * in the connect option of the EC2 dashboard
Instances can be configured for burstable capacity: 
    - This allows for instances to obtain more CPU than the instance tpye provides

CPU/Disk/Network/StatusCheck

Summary:
    A few best practices when it comes to EC2 Instances are: security, lock down the ssh port, even remove it completely and enable SSH access through System session manager, storage, make 
    sure the boot volume ebs and data volumes are seperate. Use similar AMI's for instances to keep an immutable infrastructure, backup ebs volumes through snapshots. Some tips for instances
    is that some support burstable performance which allows them to go above the vCPU given by instance type, and some default statistics that can be views are cpu/disk/network/statuscheck
