EC2 Volumes and encryption


EC2 EBS Volumes:
    durable block level devices that are attached to ec2 instances
    - provide flexibility by allowing increase of size and IOPS dynamically
    * volume and instance must be on same AZ
    Multi-attach:
        some instances and volumes support attaching to multiple instances if they have Nitro support such as the t3 general purpose
        - good for low-latency file storage that needs to be shared between instances
    
    EBS Volume tpyes:
        1) Generic purpose SSD
            - generic workload with 3000 iops
        2) Provisioned IOPS
            - high throughput workloads
            - if needing more than 3000 iops
        3) Throughput optimized
            - low cost hdd for frequently accessed workloads
        4) Cold HDD
            - lowest cost hdd for less frequently accessed workloads
        5) magnetic
            - workloads were data is infrequently accessed
    
    EBS Encryption:
        uses encryption keys using AES-256 algorithm to encrypt volumes and snapshots
        - encryption happens on the ec2 instance
        * can encrypt the boot and data volumes of ec2 instances
        Supported encyption:
            - data at rest in the volume
            - data moving between volume and ec2 instance
            - snapshots created from an encrypted volume
            - volumes from an encrypted volume

EC2 Key Pairs:
    private and public key used to connect to ec2 instances
    - placed in ~./.ssh/authorized_keys
Summary:
    EC2 EBS volumes make up the block storage mechanism to mount filesystems onto instances. EBS volumes support resizing and provisioning more IOPS if needed. General purpose SSD's are 
    mostly used for general purpose work and support 3000 IOPS. Provisioned IOPS should be used for more IO intensive workloads as it can have a far greater number of IOPS. Provisioned IOPS 
    also support multi attach to bind multiple ec2 instances to a volume. There is throughput optimized which is just a hdd type disk good for frequently accessed data, cold hdd for infrequently
    accessed data, and magnetic disk. Ebs encryption is done through KMS using AES-256 encryption. Encryption is done on the instance and can be applied to the volume and even snapshots.
