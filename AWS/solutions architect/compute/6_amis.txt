AMI Images

What is an AMI:
    defines how to launch an ec2 instance

    Includes the following:
        OS Template:
            can either be an ebs volume or an instance-store backed ami
        Launch permissions:
            which AWS accounts can use the AMI
        Block Device Mapping:
            devices to attach to instance on launch

Using an AMI:
    Ami's can be copied between or within the same region

Creating an AMI:
    1) Launch an instance from an existing AMI
    2) customize the software
    3) save instance as an AMI
    Root volume type changes creation process:
        EBS:
            1) launch ec2 instance from an ami
            2) customize instance
            3) create the image
        Instance-store:
            1) launch ec2 instance from ami
            2) customize instance
            3) bundle the root volume:
                - produces a bundle that holds an image manifest.xml and these are uploaded to an s3 bucket
                - next register the AMI

Summary:
    AMI's make the backbone of EC2 Instances. An ami includes an os template that is specified by the root ebs volume or instance store, launch permissions that determine who can
    use the ami, and a block device mapping. AMI's are located to a region and can be shared or copied over to other regions. Creating AMI's differes between ebs backed and instance store.
    EBS volumes require no extra work and are created from a running instace. Instance store backed instances require the AMI to be bundled into a manifest.xml and then pushed to an 
    s3 bucket.
