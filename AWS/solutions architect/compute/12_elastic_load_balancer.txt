ELB

What is:
    accepts traffic to distribute across EC2 instances
    Elastic:
        scales in and out as traffic changes overtime
    Provides healthchecks to registered targets meaning it only routes traffic to healthy targets
    * can route traffic on-premise and in the cloud
    * cross-zone loadbalancing: route traffic to multiple AZ's across ELB's
        - always enabled for ALB but dissabled by default for NLB
Best practices:
    Bind a load balancer to multiple availability zone to provide fault tolerance

Application Load Balaner:
    application level of OSI layer
    - routing rules make up the directions of traffic with defined ports and protocols
        - a routing rules is made of rules that have priority and conditions
        - a rule must have a default action
    Targets:
        define the instances to send traffic to
        Targets can be registered to multiple target groups
    
    How it works:
        ALB evaluates rules in priority order to determine the rule to apply and send traffic to a specific instance based on target groups
        * Traffic is routed based on request content
        Routing algorithm:
            - round robin (DEFAULT)
            - least requests
    
    ALB and Route53: ALB can be used for failover with route53 as active/passive 
    ALB and cloundfront: ALB can be used as a cloudfront origin
    ALB and global accelerator endpoint: ALB can be used to improve performance for instances by imrpoving availability through routing traffic through AWS network 
    ALB vs NLB: ALB should be used for path based routing
    ALB and fargate: interact with fargate task
    ALB and Elasticache:
        Elasticache can be used as a session store that would allow for all instances in a target group to obtain session state for a user
        - Distributed
    

ALB Summary:
    ALB's sit at layer 7 of the OSI model, application layer, and handle routing based on the contents of the user request such as port and path. This differes from NLB that
    sits at layer 4. ALB's are route traffic to instances associated with target groups, and instances can be associated with more than one target group. These groups have their health 
    checked and are removed if determined to be unhealthy. Traffic is sent to instances based on routing rules which have a priority and conditions. A rule has to have a default rule. 
    An ALB can be used as a cloudfront origin rather than s3, can be used for active failover routing for route53, can use elasticache session store for a distributed session state 
    to facilitate sticky sessions, and also be used as a global accelerator to improve performance by routing traffic through the AWS network.
