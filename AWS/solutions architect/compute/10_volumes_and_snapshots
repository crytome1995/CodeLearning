Volumes and snapshots

EBS Volume:
    durable block level storage 
    - can modify the size or iops on live instances
    Root volumes support:
        general purpose, provisioned iops, and magnetic
    EBS volumes are replicated in an AZ

    Encryption:
        uses kms master keys using AES-256 encryption
    
    Backup/Snapshots:
        can take snapshots and store to s3 from running instances
        * snapshots save data from the latest unique blocks created to avoid duplication
        snapshots use lazy loading:
            meaning an instance will not have all data from the snapshot rite away, but if it requests data the volume does not have yet it will be loaded from s3

Summary:
    An ebs volume is a durable block level storage for instances. EBS volumes, except the root volume can be detached and attacehd to other instances in the same region.
    There are general purpose ssd, proviosned iops ssd's, magnetic, throughput optizimed, and cold hdd EBS storage types. EBS volumes can be encrypted using kms master keys using
    AES-256 encryption. Snapshots can be taken of EBS volumes to provide point in time recovery. Snapshots take into account only recent block changes to avoid data duplication. Snapshots 
    use lazy loading to bring up instances faster.
