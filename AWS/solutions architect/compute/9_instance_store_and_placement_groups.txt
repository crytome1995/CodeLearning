Instance Store and Palcement groups
    Instance-store: block level storage located on disk
    Placement group: determines how the instances are placed on the hypervisor
        Two type:
            1) spread
            2) cluster
    
Instance-store: temporary block storage for instance buffers or scratch data
    - can not detach and attach to another instance
    - if the instance stops the data on the instance store is lost

Placement group: how instances are placed on the hypervisor
    - no charge for placement group
    2 types:
        1) Cluster:
            instances are placed on a single AZ
            - requires instances to have enhanced networking
            Recommended to launch all instances of the same type
                - if not: can cause an insufficient capacity error
        2) Spread:
            each instance is launched on its own hypervisor in differnent AZ's
            * Allows for fault tolerance
            Spread placement groups are not supported with dedicated hosts or instances
            Can have the request blocked if not enough resources are available
            Allows for different instance types

Summary:
    Instance store is what should be used for data that does not need to persists after instance termination. An instance store volume can not be detached
    and attached to a new volume. Placement groups control the placement of ec2 instances on aws. There are two types. Cluster places instances in the same AZ. With cluster placement groups
    there is no garantee of capacity for the placement group if changing the instance type. Cluster networking requires the instances to have enahnced networking enabled. Spread placement 
    groups put instances on seperate hypervisors across individual AZ's. This allows for HA. Spread placement groups can have different instance types associated with them. Not supported with
    dedicated instances or hosts.
