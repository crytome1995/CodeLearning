EBS Raid Options

What is an EBS Raid option
    provides faster I/O performance using striping
        Striping: act of making segments of data and distributing it across multiple disk spaces
    RAID 0: stripes volumes together
    RAID 1: mirros two volumes together
    * Do not use raid for boot volume because there is a chance a mirroed volume can fail which will fail the boot

    RAID 0:
        - use when I/O performacne is required over fault tolerance
        - loss of a volume will result in complete data loss of the data array
    RAID 1: 
        - use when fault tolerance is most important
        - data is mirrored across volumes

Summary:
    When settign up volumes there are two options for RAID settings of a volume. RAID 0 and RAID 1. RAID 0 provides a striping mechanism to volumes by segmenting data across the volume array.
    This is prefered to be used when I/O performance is prefered over fault tolerance because the lose of one volume is a complete loss of data. Raid 1 uses mirroring to provide a redundancy 
    in data. This raid level should be sued when fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance.
