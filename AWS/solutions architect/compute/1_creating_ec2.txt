What is an EC2:
    scalable compute capacity that run on bare-metal servers
        - Uses hyperviser on the host kernel that is in charge of running guest operating systems
    Configurability for the OS:
        - AMI & EC2 instance-type
    SSH: handled through key-pairs
        - aws holds onto the public key
    
    * EC2 Storage options:
        1) Instance Store: Ephermeral(temporary)
            - removed when instanced is stopped/terminated or hibernated
        2) EBS volumes:
            - keps reguardless of instance state
    
    * EC2 Networking and Security:
        Security groups:
            - protocols/ports/ip's that can reach ec2 instances in a VPC's subnet
        Static IPv4 addresses:
            - Elastic IP address that can be bound to an ec2

AMI:
    Information in-order to launch and instance
    Included in an AMI:
        1) One or more EBS snapshots: used to configure ec2 instance on launche
        OR 
        1) Instance Store
        2) Launch Permissions: controll which accounts can use the AMI
    
    AMI Instance Types:
        controll the resources the os gues guest
        Five categories:
            1) General purpose:
                A#: scale out arm based workloads
                T#: small databases
                M#: primary general purpose type 
            2) Compute Optomized
                C4: compute intensive
                C5: compute intensive with choice of processors
                C5N: high compute applications
            3) Memory Optomized
                R4: memory intensive operations
                X1: In memory storage
                Z1D: high compute and high memory footprint
            4) Accelerated Computing
                P2
                G3
                F1
            5) Storage Optimized
                H1
                I3
                D2

Summary:
    An EC2 instance is a virtual guest operating system that sits ontop of the host barmetal server that is managed by a hyperviser. An EC2 instance is made from two building blocks,
    the AMi that constructs the host system, and the instance type that determines the resources provisioned to the instance. Instances can either make use of ephermeral storage,
    instance store, or persistent store which is EBS. Networking to Ec2 instances is controlled through security groups that can have protocols, ports, and IPS specified that can
    reach the ec2 instances. There are many instance type: general purpose, network optimized, compute optimized, accelerated computing, memory optizimed.
