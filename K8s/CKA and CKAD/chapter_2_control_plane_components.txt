Control Plane Components

kube-api server: front end of the control plane
etcd: key value store for the state of the CLUSTER
kube-scheduler: selects nodes for pods to run on
kube-controller-manager: emebeds all controllers:
    - node controller, replication controller, endpoints controller, service and token controllers

Worker nodes components:
kubelet: makes sure each pod on then node is running correctly
kube-proxy: handles networking requirements for service demands

How control plane pods are brought up:"
    on each controller sits a folder /etc/kubenetes/manifests/
        - this directory holds the static pod manifests for the control plane
