NETWORKING

Basics:
    Network is flat: each pod can see eachother, each container in a pod shares the same IP
    Intra-pod-communication:
        ports can not collide between pods because each pod has its own IP
    Inter-pod-communication:
        pods can communicate through discovery mechanisms such as DNS
    Pod-to-service:
        kube-proxy handles load balancing network across a set of pods
        * each node has a kube-proxy which tracks pods IP'S

Kubernetes-networking vs Docker netowking:
    Docker: Each container exposes its port to the underlying node, but can cause
    conflicts if two containers attempt to expose the same port
    * must go through the hosts ip to interact with the container
    Graph:
        container: ip 123.123.123.123 -> eth0:
                                            eth0: primary network interface  can be viewed
                                                    through ifconfig cli
                    eth0 -> veth:
                                veth: virtual ethernet interace
                                        used to communicate to the host namespace
                    veth -> docker0:
                        docker0 is the bridge to the host-system
                        docker0 -> host


Linux Networking Basics:
    Linux has a single physical network interface, but this can be divided into 
    smaller namespaces

    Netowrk namespaces:
        namespaces are isolated regions of network on the same host
        namespaces can not talk to eachothr unless done so through bridges/gateways/switches
    Veth:
        represent physical network devices that are assigned to a namespace
        * isolation of namespaces 
        * assign the veth to the namespace and physical device
    Bridges:
        connect network segments to allow node communication
        * opperates at
            l1: physical
            l2: network
    MTU: maximum transmission unit
        how much data in bytes can be sent PER packet
        higher MTU reduces throughput due to having to wait for entire packet


SHIT:
    Namespaces are isolations of the host network
    Namesapces can not talk to eachother by default
    To link namespaces together they must either have:
        a veth pair linking the two
        or a veth pair attached to a bridge
    For external traffic to interact with a namespace a NAT network address translation
    needs to be enabled with MASQUERADE option
